**An open-source, MCP-native, all-in-one platform for agencies and operators.** Run per-tenant client **websites**, a **CRM**, an AI-powered **Company Brain** (RAG over client knowledge), workflow **automations**, **bookings**, a **storefront**, **email** campaigns, **surveys**, e-signatures, and **Stripe billing** — from one multi-tenant portal. Then drive *all* of it through an AI agent: the platform ships **200+ Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools**, so Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client can build pages, manage the CRM, send campaigns, and operate the whole system programmatically.

Think *"open-source, agent-operable alternative to the usual stack of a site builder + CRM + email tool + booking app + knowledge base"* — unbundled into one self-hostable codebase.

## Why it's different

- **MCP-native, not MCP-bolted-on.** 200+ scoped MCP tools span the entire platform surface (content, CRM, brain, commerce, email, bookings, billing). Build a site or run an outreach campaign by *talking to an agent*.
- **All-in-one & multi-tenant.** A single Next.js codebase serves an internal admin panel, a per-tenant client portal, and per-tenant public websites.
- **Block-based CMS + visual editor.** Content is typed JSON blocks edited in an iframe visual page builder.
- **AI Company Brain.** Per-tenant retrieval-augmented knowledge base over client material.
- **Self-hostable.** Apache-2.0 licensed. Bring your own Postgres and API keys.

> Open-sourced from a production codebase. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for how the codebase is organized (it has an unusually rich set of contributor/architecture docs) and **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** to report a vulnerability.

## Architecture overview

### Three route trees, three audiences

| Route prefix | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `app/admin/**` | Internal (us) | Global admin panel — super-admin operations, cross-tenant views, system health |
| `app/portal/**` | Per-tenant client | Client-facing portal — websites, CRM, brain, automations, billing, settings |
| `app/sites/**` and `app/s/**` | Public | Per-tenant public websites rendered from block-based post content |

### API envelope

Every API route returns `{ success: true, data: ... }` on success or `{ success: false, error: "..." }` on failure. Tenant routes resolve the active site via `lib/active-client.ts` plus site-resolver middleware — never derive tenant identity from the request body or query params. Use `simplerdev-feature-scaffold` to generate routes in lockstep; do not hand-roll the pattern.

### Tenancy

All data is keyed by `clientId` and `siteId`. Row-level queries must filter on these columns. Run `bun test:tenancy` after any data-access change to verify there is no cross-tenant data leakage.

### Block-based CMS

Content is stored as typed JSON arrays in `posts.content`. Block schemas live in `lib/blocks/registry.ts`; render cases live in `app/sites/`. Blocks are universal — no block type is client-specific. Use `simplerdev-block-type` to scaffold a new block type (interface, render component, registry entry, and production renderer case all move together).

### Visual editor

The block editor lives at `app/portal/websites/[siteId]/posts/[id]/edit`. It uses an iframe preview with selection/resize overlays and a postMessage protocol between the host shell and the preview frame. See `components/portal/visual-editor/CLAUDE.md` before touching this area.

### Company Brain

AI-powered knowledge base per tenant. Embeddings are generated via OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`) and stored in Postgres. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries route through `lib/ai/` and `lib/brain/`. See `lib/ai/CLAUDE.md` for patterns and the 70% coverage floor that applies to this domain.

### MCP server

An in-repo Model Context Protocol server exposes platform tools to AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). Tools are registered in `lib/mcp/` via a tool registrar pattern with scope guards. Use `simplerdev-mcp-tool` to add a new tool — handler, schema, and scope guard are registered in lockstep.

## Prerequisites and setup

**Requirements:** Bun 1.3.11+, PostgreSQL 14+, Node.js 20+ (for scripts that use `tsx`).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bun install

# 2. Copy environment variables and fill in values
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Key environment variables to set in `.env.local`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth session secret |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Platform-level Anthropic key (BYOK fallback) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Brain embeddings fallback |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe billing |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64 hex chars — encrypts BYOK client API keys. Generate: `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `PORTAL_KMS_KEY` | Base64 key for plugin JWT signing. Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `DROPBOX_SIGN_API_KEY` | E-signature contracts |

See `.env.example` for the full list and descriptions.

```bash
# 3. Run database migrations
bun run db:migrate

# 4. (Optional) Seed an admin user
bun run db:seed
```

---

## Development

```bash
bun dev            # start the Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000
bun run lint       # ESLint
bun run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit — run after any non-trivial edit batch
```

---

## Testing

Tests are split into three layers driven by a single runner script.

| Layer | Path | Runner | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | Vitest | `bun test` |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | Vitest + real DB | `bun test:integration:local` |
| E2E | `tests/e2e/` | Playwright | `bun run test:e2e` |

### Gate commands

```bash
# Unit tests
scripts/test.sh --layer=unit --no-coverage          # alias: bun test

# Integration tests (requires a running DB)
bun test:integration:local                          # spins up a local DB, then runs

# E2E tests
scripts/test.sh --layer=e2e --no-coverage

# QA gate — run before declaring any feature done
bun test:critical                                   # Playwright @critical golden-path subset

# Tenancy regression — run after every data-access change
bun test:tenancy                                    # integration suite @tenancy tag
```

### Local CI gate

`scripts/ci-local.sh` runs the full suite of checks locally (architecture boundaries, file-size budgets, doc drift, lint, typecheck, unit tests). It is wired into git pre-commit and pre-push hooks under `.githooks/`.

```bash
scripts/ci-local.sh           # full gate
scripts/ci-local.sh --quick   # fast checks only (no tsc/tests)
scripts/ci-local.sh --full    # + tenancy + critical e2e (needs DB + Playwright)
```

### Coverage floors

Defined in `vitest.config.ts`. Project-wide: 60% lines/statements/functions, 50% branches. Higher floors apply to `lib/billing`, `lib/ai`, `lib/agency`, `lib/esign`, `lib/chat` (70%) and `lib/crypto` (90%). See [`tests/CI-GATES.md`](tests/CI-GATES.md) for details.

---

## Database and migrations

Schema is defined as per-domain Drizzle modules under `lib/db/schema/`. Migration SQL in `drizzle/*.sql` is **generated — never edit it by hand**.

```bash
# After editing lib/db/schema/ files:
bun run db:generate    # generates new migration files under drizzle/

# Apply pending migrations (refuses prod DATABASE_URLs via db:verify-target):
bun run db:migrate

# Interactive schema browser:
bun run db:studio
```

See [`lib/db/CLAUDE.md`](lib/db/CLAUDE.md) for tenancy invariants and footguns.

## Agentic development

This repo is built to be worked on by AI agents (primarily Claude Code) alongside humans. The agent tooling is first-class infrastructure, not an add-on.

### Agent navigation

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the root agent operating guide: architecture invariants, commands, conventions, don't-touch zones.
- Nested `CLAUDE.md` files carry per-area invariants and god-file warnings, loaded automatically when an agent works in that subtree: `app/portal/`, `app/admin/`, `lib/blocks/`, `lib/mcp/`, `lib/db/`, `lib/ai/`, `components/portal/visual-editor/`, `tests/`.
- `.claude/index.md` — the navigation map: "I need to work on X" → the right nested guide, skill, or doc.
- `graphify-out/` — a generated knowledge graph of the codebase, rebuilt on commit via git hooks, used for broad cross-cutting questions.

### Skills (scaffolding workflows)

Repeatable engineering tasks are encoded as Claude Code skills so the lockstep pieces never drift apart:

| Skill | Produces |
|---|---|
| `simplerdev-feature-scaffold` | CRUD resource: schema + API route (envelope pattern) + e2e test |
| `simplerdev-block-type` | CMS block: TS interface, render component, registry entry, production renderer case, `/api/blocks` metadata |
| `simplerdev-mcp-tool` | MCP tool: handler + input schema + scope guard, registered in lockstep |
| `site-migration` | Imports an existing external website into the platform |
| `sd-create-page` / `-deck` / `-email` / `-survey` | Portal content authored via the in-repo MCP server, returned as draft + approval URL |

See `docs/skills/` for the full reference.

### Subagents and orchestration

Larger work runs through an orchestration hierarchy: a planning model decomposes work and dispatches well-scoped units to worker agents in parallel (e.g. `block-orchestrator` driving `block-implementer` workers for the CMS-blocks audit). Workers operate under an escalation contract — anything beyond a mechanical change is promoted back to the planner rather than guessed at (see `CLAUDE.md` § Agent operating rules).

### Autonomous dev loop

The `dev-block` skill runs hands-off development sessions driven by an n8n workflow: pick a GitHub issue labeled `claude`, implement, run gates, commit, return structured JSON for the loop to route on. State and retro notes live in `.claude/HANDS_OFF_DEV_PLAN.md` and `.claude/learnings.md`.

### Guardrails (architecture fitness functions)

Agent- and human-authored changes are held to the same automated invariants, wired into the `.githooks/` pre-commit and pre-push hooks:

- `scripts/check-doc-drift.ts` — agent-facing docs may not reference moved or deleted files
- `scripts/check-file-budget.ts` — file-size budget with a god-file ratchet (new-file cap 800 lines)
- `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` — architectural boundary rules (route trees, layering)
- `knip.json` — dead-code detection
- `scripts/ci-local.sh` — the local CI gate (lint, typecheck, unit tests) run at pre-push

## Deployment

The platform deploys to Vercel (region `iad1`) using Next.js framework mode. Install uses `bun install --frozen-lockfile`; build uses `next build`. A set of Vercel cron jobs (defined in `vercel.json`) drive background work including embedding processing, Gmail/Drive watch renewal, automation scheduling, brain daily notes, usage rollup, and booking reminders. See [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) for the full cron schedule.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This codebase ships with an unusually rich set of contributor docs: **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** explains how the monorepo is organized and how to add a block type, an MCP tool, or a CRUD resource; the root [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) plus per-subsystem nested `CLAUDE.md` files document the architecture invariants. New here? Start with a [`good first issue`](../../issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Use conventional commits (`feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, …). Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun test` before opening a PR; any change touching tenant data must pass `bun test:tenancy`.
